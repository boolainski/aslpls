## Installation
Put copy everything in scripts/ directory **keeping** the directory structure

## New ascii art
The file must be in arts/ subdirectory and named **ascii.***bind***.txt** where _bind_ will be the command.

Actually, it arts/ contains ascii.coffee.txt and ascii.chocolate.txt, giving you !coffee and !chocolate
